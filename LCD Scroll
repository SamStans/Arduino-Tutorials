/* Setting up the LCD to the arduino:
 * Materials needed- LCD, potentiometer, bread board, arduino, wire, 220 ohm resistor
 * The LCD has 16 pins on it, so this little tutorial will teach you what pins to use and where to connect them to
 * (If your LCD doesn't have pre-soldered pins, you'll have to solder the wires on to there) 
 * Step one- Place LCD horizontally on the horizontal bread board. Place potentiometer on the bread board, but out of the way of the LCD
 * Step two- connect LCD to bread board
 *    Pin 1- connect VSS to a ground rail on the bread board
 *    Pin 2- connect VDD to the positive rail on the bread board
 *    Pin 3- connect V0 to the middle pin of the potentiometer
 *    Pin 4- connect RS to digital pin 12(or any digital pin- does not have to be a PWM pin)
 *    Pin 5- connect RW to ground rail
 *    Pin 6- connect E to digital pin 11 (must be any PWM digital pin)
 *    Pin 16- connect K to ground rail
 *    Pin 15- connect A to the positive rail using a 220 ohm resistor
 *    Pin 14- connect D7 to digital pin 2 (or any digital pin- does not have to be a PWM pin)
 *    Pin 13- connect D6 to digital pin 3 (must be any PWM digital pin)
 *    Pin 12- connect D5 to digital pin 4 (or any digital pin- does not have to be a PWM pin)
 *    Pin 11- connect D4 to digital pin 5 (must be any PWM digital pin)
 * Step three- Connect one of the outside pins of the potentiometer to the ground rail and the other to the positive rail
 * Step four- Connect the ground rail to "GND" on your arduino and the positive rail to "5v"
 * 
 * Adjusting the potentiometer will adjust the contrast of the symbols
 * If you switch the resistor with a potentiometer, that'll allow you to adjust the contrast of the backlight
